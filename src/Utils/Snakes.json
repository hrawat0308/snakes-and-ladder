        "description": "We don’t know how exactly this name came up, but in Greek; python means serpent and molurus means some kind of snake. Indian Rock Python is one of the heaviest and longest snakes found in the country. As per authenticated record they can grow more than 9 meters (about 30 feet). Despite being common in most part of the country, it is difficult to see them in the wild. They are mainly nocturnal and equipped with thermal sensing pits on their jaws. Despite being heavy they are highly arboreal snakes. They belong to group commonly known as boa constrictor. And they kill their prey by asphyxiation or cutting off the blood supply by coiling around the prey’s body. This causes cardiac arrest and instant death."
